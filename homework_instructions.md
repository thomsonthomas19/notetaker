# Note Taker - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

In this activity you'll build a Node, Express, and MySQL powered note-taking application. The user will have the ability to create, read, and delete notes from a MySQL database.

You will use Express to handle routing and server HTML as well as JSON. MySQL to store notes, and jQuery for AJAX requests and handling other front-end logic.


### Before You Begin

* Check out these demo versions of the site:

* [Harder Version](https://note-taker-fsf.herokuapp.com/)

  * The user can save, view, and delete notes without having to refresh or navigate to a different page to see the changes.

* [Easier Version](https://note-taker-easier-fsf.herokuapp.com/)

  * The user can save, view, or delete notes, but must refresh or navigate to a different page to see the changes.

* The backend for both these applications is _exactly_ the same. Whichever version of the application you choose to work on, complete the server-side code first and verify your API routes work properly with Postman.

### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Instructions

1. Create the backend for the application first. Start by using the provided `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` file create a database and seed some starter data.

2. Create a `server.js` file that starts a basic express server.

3. Require the `connection.js` file provided and add API routes for:

  * Retrieving all notes from the database and returning them to the user as JSON.

  * Saving a new note to the database using the data passed on `req.body`.

  * Deleting a note from the database using `req.params.id`.

4. Test that all your API routes work properly using Postman.

5. Add a `/` route for serving an `index.html` file (the welcome page).

6. Add a `/notes` route for serving a `notes.html` file (the page for viewing, saving, deleting notes).

7. Style the `index.html` page and add a description of the application.

8. Decide whether you'd like to attempt the easier or more difficult assignment. If you're unsure, attempt the easier version first.

9. Code the front-end logic for displaying the list of notes.

10. Code the front-end logic for submitting a new note.

11. Code the front-end logic for deleting a note from the database.

12. Deploy the assignment on Heroku using the [MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.md](../03-Supplemental/MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.md) guide.

### Hints

* You can use HTML [data-* attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) to keep track of the data attached to each note in the HTML, or you can also use the [jQuery data method](https://api.jquery.com/data/) to accomplish this.

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Minimum Requirements

Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed. Adding a README.md as well as adding this homework to your portfolio are required as well and more information can be found below.

### Hosting on Heroku

Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. Please note that while **Heroku is free**, it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database.

Please see [Herokuâ€™s Account Verification Information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) for more details.

### Create a README.md

Add a `README.md` to your repository describing the project. Here are some resources for creating your `README.md`. Here are some resources to help you along the way:

* [About READMEs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/)

* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Add To Your Portfolio

After completing the homework please add the piece to your portfolio. Make sure to add a link to your updated portfolio in the comments section of your homework so the TAs can easily ensure you completed this step when they are grading the assignment. To receive an 'A' on any assignment, you must link to it from your portfolio.
